NAME
    cpackage - Create installation packages from CPAN modules

SYNOPSYS
     cpackage My::CPAN::Module
     cpackage --mirror http://cpan.local --mirror-only My::Private::Module

DESCRIPTION
    cpackage builds installation packages from CPAN modules, containing all
    dependencies and an install.pl script. Running install.pl will install
    the module (and dependencies) without requiring Internet access or a
    configured CPAN client on the target machine.

  Usage
    To create an installer from a CPAN module, run the command:

     cpackage My::CPAN::Module

    cpackage will use cpanm to download the module and its dependencies -
    these files will be placed in the packages/ directory. Your currently
    installed version of cpanm will be copied and bundled into the bin/
    directory.

    Finally an install.pl file will be written - running this script will
    install the module together with its dependencies.

    All files will be written to the current working directory.

  Using your own CPAN mirror
    cpackage accepts the same command-line options as cpanm, so you can use
    it to build an installer from your own private CPAN or DarkPAN mirror.

     cpackage --mirror http://my.cpan --mirror-only My::Private::Module

    If you have a DarkPAN mirror set up (e.g. using CPAN::Mini::Inject) you
    can create installers that contain a mix of private code and public CPAN
    code with full dependency resolution between the two.

  Running the installer
    To run the generated installer script, use the command:

     perl install.pl

    Because the installer uses the bundled copy of cpanm, you can also give
    any of cpanm's standard options, e.g.

     perl install.pl --sudo
